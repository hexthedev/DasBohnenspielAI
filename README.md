# DasBohnenspielAI
Das Bohnenspiel AI project implemented with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search. 

## General Idea
Das Bohnenspiel AI uses a modified Monte Carlo Tree method to choose the agents appropriate next move. Move choice is based on the outcome of numerous random game simulations. The agent chooses the next move that, after simulation, has the highest ratio of wins to total games played. I have included my source code, which is attached to a larger project which I do not have permission to release. Instead I have added comments to the code so that anyone else who wishes to implement the same design in another context can easily piece the logic together. 

## Logic, PseudoCode and explanations
Still To come...
